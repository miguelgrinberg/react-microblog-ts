React-Microblog-TS
==================

This is a version of the microblogging application featured in my
[React Mega-Tutorial](https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/introducing-the-react-mega-tutorial)
book, but written in TypeScript instead of plain JavaScript.

After you have learned with my book, you can compare the
[original code](https://github.com/miguelgrinberg/react-microblog) against
this repository to learn what are the changes you have to adopt if you want to
write your application in TypeScript with full typing checks.
